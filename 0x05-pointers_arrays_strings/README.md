# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I learned:
* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables
# Tasks
###### 0. 98 Battery st.
Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
* Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);
###### 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream
Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
* Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);
